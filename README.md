# Description

NATASHA is a dataset of vibrations measured by a magneto-elastic beam composed of a clamped beam interacting with two permanent magnets in a bistable configuration. The experimental setup is formed by a cantilever steel beam with dimensions of 150 x 15 x 0.65 mm. The beam-free end is distant from 5 mm to two magnets placed 65 mm one to the other.

The setup includes the following:

 <li>  Tira shaker TV51120-M</li>
	 <li>  Polytec OFV-525/-5000-S modular laser vibrometer</li>
	 <li> Dytran load cell model 1022V (IEPE force sensor)</li>
 <li>  m+p VibPilot acquisition system</li>

The shaker was attached 25 mm distant from the clamp. Velocity was measured through the laser vibrometer in the free end of the beam. All signals were sampled with 1024 Hz.

To characterize the baseline condition of the structure ("healthy" state), two different input signals were used: chirp and mono-harmonic sine:

  <li>  Chirp input from 5 to 30 Hz, with 8192 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 V. Each test was repeated 10 times to check repeatability</li>
   <li>  Sine input with a frequency of 20 Hz, with 81920 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 V</li>
   
This data is presented in the file "identificationdata.mat" which has two MATLAB structures named "data\_chirp" and "data\_sine". The variables contained in both variables are presented in Table 1.

The gap between the free end of the beam and the magnets was modified from 5 mm up to 17.5 mm to simulate a structural variation. This change in the distance is expected to change both the linear and nonlinear behavior of the system. Table 2 shows the structural states simulated in the system.
